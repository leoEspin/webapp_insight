In the U.S. it is a know problem that [food labels are often difficult to interpret](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/01/24/688042266/grocery-shoppers-dont-always-know-what-s-best-for-them-can-better-food-labeling). In order to help customers make healthier food choices I add product-tailored visual cues to food labels to try to simplify their interpretation.

I used *unsupervised learning* for creating a labeling system that highlights the most salient information of a given food product. In my webapp, the user inputs smartphone photos of the barcodes of the products of interest and the webapp will download the nutrient information and render the nutrition labels with selected  information highlighted.
